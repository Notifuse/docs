## S3 Storage Configuration

Configure your S3-compatible storage with these settings:

- **S3 Endpoint**: Your S3-compatible storage endpoint URL
- **S3 Access Key**: Access key for authentication
- **S3 Secret Key**: Secret key for authentication
- **S3 Bucket**: Bucket name where files will be stored
- **S3 Region**: Storage region (e.g., us-east-1)

## CDN Configuration

### CDN Endpoint

- **Purpose**: URL of the CDN that caches your files
- **Benefit**: Faster file delivery and reduced bandwidth costs
- **Optional**: CDN configuration is not required but recommended

### URL Customization

When a CDN endpoint is configured, file URLs in your email templates will use the CDN URL instead of the direct S3 URL for optimized delivery.

## CORS Configuration

To allow the file manager to upload files directly from your browser, you need to configure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) on your storage bucket.

### Cloudflare R2 / AWS S3

Create a CORS policy with the following configuration:

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "POST", "HEAD", "DELETE", "PUT"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"]
  }
]
```

<Tip>For production, replace `"*"` in `AllowedOrigins` with your Notifuse console URL for better security.</Tip>

### Google Cloud Storage

For GCS, use the `gsutil` command with a JSON configuration file:

```json
[
  {
    "origin": ["*"],
    "method": ["GET", "POST", "HEAD", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"],
    "responseHeader": ["Content-Type", "*"]
  }
]
```

Apply the CORS configuration:

```bash
gsutil cors set cors.json gs://your-bucket-name
```

## Supported Storage Providers

Files can be uploaded to any S3-compatible storage service:

- Amazon S3
- Cloudflare R2
- DigitalOcean Spaces
- Wasabi
- MinIO
- Backblaze B2
- Google Cloud Storage (S3 API)

## Self-Hosted S3 Option

If you prefer not to use cloud storage providers, you can run your own S3-compatible storage server using our self-hosted solution:

  A lightweight, Docker-based S3-compatible storage server perfect for self-hosting Notifuse without external dependencies.
</Card>

This option is ideal for:
- Air-gapped or offline environments
- Development and testing
- Users who want full control over their data
- Avoiding cloud provider costs

## File Usage

Once configured, uploaded files can be used in:

- Email template images
- Attachments
- Brand assets (logos, headers)
- Any media content in your email campaigns

## Template Editor Integration

The visual email editor provides seamless access to your file manager:

- **Modal Access**: File manager opens in a modal while creating templates
- **Direct Integration**: Select and insert files directly from the editor
- **Real-Time Upload**: Upload new files without leaving the template editor
