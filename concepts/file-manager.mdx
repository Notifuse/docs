## S3 Storage Configuration

Configure your S3-compatible storage with these settings:

- **S3 Endpoint**: Your S3-compatible storage endpoint URL
- **S3 Access Key**: Access key for authentication
- **S3 Secret Key**: Secret key for authentication
- **S3 Bucket**: Bucket name where files will be stored
- **S3 Region**: Storage region (e.g., us-east-1)

## CDN Configuration

### CDN Endpoint

- **Purpose**: URL of the CDN that caches your files
- **Benefit**: Faster file delivery and reduced bandwidth costs
- **Optional**: CDN configuration is not required but recommended

### URL Customization

When a CDN endpoint is configured, file URLs in your email templates will use the CDN URL instead of the direct S3 URL for optimized delivery.

## Supported Storage Providers

Files can be uploaded to any S3-compatible storage service:

- Amazon S3
- DigitalOcean Spaces
- Wasabi
- MinIO
- Backblaze B2
- Google Cloud Storage (S3 API)

## File Usage

Once configured, uploaded files can be used in:

- Email template images
- Attachments
- Brand assets (logos, headers)
- Any media content in your email campaigns

## Template Editor Integration

The visual email editor provides seamless access to your file manager:

- **Modal Access**: File manager opens in a modal while creating templates
- **Direct Integration**: Select and insert files directly from the editor
- **Real-Time Upload**: Upload new files without leaving the template editor
