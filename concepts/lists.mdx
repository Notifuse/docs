## Contact Statuses

Contacts within lists can have different statuses that determine their engagement eligibility:

| Status           | Email Delivery           | Description                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Active**       | ✅ Can receive emails    | Confirmed subscribers eligible for broadcasts |
| **Pending**      | ❌ Cannot receive emails | Waiting for double opt-in confirmation        |
| **Unsubscribed** | ❌ Cannot receive emails | Opted out of receiving communications         |
| **Bounced**      | ❌ Cannot receive emails | Email address is invalid or unreachable       |
| **Complained**   | ❌ Cannot receive emails | Marked emails as spam                         |

> **Important**: Only contacts with **"active"** status can receive emails from broadcast campaigns.

## List Visibility

### Public Lists

- **Notification Center**: ✅ Appear in the notification center
- **Subscriber Access**: Users can see and subscribe to these lists through your notification center
- **Use Case**: Ideal for newsletters, announcements, and general communications

### Private Lists

- **Notification Center**: ❌ Do not appear in the notification center
- **Subscriber Access**: Only accessible through direct management or API
- **Use Case**: Perfect for internal communications, VIP segments, transactional lists, or one-time broadcasts

## Double Opt-In Configuration

### Enabling Double Opt-In

When you activate double opt-in for a list:

- **Imported Contacts**: Contacts added via CSV import or API will always be **"active"** (they bypass double opt-in)
- **Anonymous Subscribers**: Users subscribing via forms (like a newsletter signup on your website) will be **"pending"**
- **Confirmation Required**: Pending contacts must click a confirmation link in their email to become "active"
- **Compliance**: Helps ensure GDPR compliance and reduces spam complaints

**Example**: A visitor fills out a newsletter form on your website → they receive a confirmation email → they click the link (which renders the notification center) → status changes from "pending" to "active"

### Welcome Template (Optional)

- **Purpose**: Automatically sent to contacts when they become "active"
- **Timing**: Triggered after successful subscription or double opt-in confirmation
- **Content**: Welcome message, onboarding information, or subscription confirmation

### Unsubscribe Template (Optional)

- **Purpose**: Automatically sent when contacts unsubscribe from the list
- **Timing**: Triggered immediately when a contact's status changes to "unsubscribed"
- **Content**: Confirmation of unsubscription, feedback request, or alternative communication options

## Best Practices

1. **Status Management**: Regularly review contact statuses to maintain list health
2. **Double Opt-In**: Enable for compliance and to ensure engaged subscribers
3. **Template Setup**: Configure welcome and unsubscribe templates for better user experience
4. **List Segmentation**: Use multiple lists to target specific audience segments effectively
