## Template Builder Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Visual editor for easy template creation

## Usage

Templates are used across Notifuse for:

- **Broadcast Campaigns**: Mass email campaigns sent to your contact lists
- **Transactional Notifications**: Automated emails triggered by user actions

## Liquid Syntax

Notifuse uses Liquid templating to insert dynamic content into your emails. Variables are enclosed in double curly braces and automatically replaced with actual data when emails are sent.

### Contact Variables

The `contact` object contains the **full contact profile** with all stored information. Access any contact field for personalization:

```liquid
Hello {{ contact.first_name }}!

Your account email: {{ contact.email }}
Full name: {{ contact.first_name }} {{ contact.last_name }}
```

**Output Example:**

```
Hello John!

Your account email: john.doe@example.com
Full name: John Doe
```

### List Variables

Reference the mailing list information:

```liquid
You're subscribed to: {{ list.name }}
List ID: {{ list.id }}
```

**Output Example:**

```
You're subscribed to: Newsletter
List ID: newsletter
```

### System URLs

Use pre-generated URLs for common actions:

#### Unsubscribe Link

```liquid
<a href="{{ unsubscribe_url }}">Unsubscribe from this list</a>
```

#### Subscription Confirmation

```liquid
<a href="{{ confirm_subscription_url }}">Confirm your subscription</a>
```

#### Notification Center

```liquid
<a href="{{ notification_center_url }}">Manage your preferences</a>
```

### Complete Example

```liquid
Welcome {{ contact.first_name }}!

Thank you for subscribing to {{ list.name }}. We're excited to have you on board!

Your registered email: {{ contact.email }}

Manage Preferences: {{ notification_center_url }}

Don't want to receive these emails?
Unsubscribe here: {{ unsubscribe_url }}
```
