## Multi-List Targeting

### Send to Multiple Lists

- **Multiple Selection**: Choose multiple contact lists for a single campaign
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Automatically skips duplicate email addresses across lists
- **Unified Audience**: Combines all selected lists into one targeted campaign

**Example**: Send a product announcement to both "Newsletter Subscribers" and "VIP Customers" lists while ensuring each contact receives only one email, even if they're on both lists.

## A/B Testing

Optimize your campaigns by testing different variations with your audience.

### Test Setup

- **Sample Size**: Test variations on a percentage of your total recipients
- **Multiple Variations**: Create different subject lines, content, or templates
- **Control Groups**: Automatically split your test audience evenly

### Winner Selection

#### Manual Selection

- **Review Results**: Analyze performance metrics for each variation
- **Choose Winner**: Manually select the best-performing variation
- **Send to Remaining**: Deploy the winning variation to the rest of your audience

#### Automatic Selection

Configure automatic winner selection based on performance metrics:

**Open Rate Winner**

- **Metric**: Highest email open rate percentage
- **Time Period**: Set a specific duration (e.g., 2 hours, 24 hours)
- **Auto-Deploy**: Automatically send winning variation after the period

**Click Rate Winner**

- **Metric**: Highest click-through rate percentage
- **Time Period**: Set a specific duration for evaluation
- **Auto-Deploy**: Automatically send winning variation after the period

### A/B Testing Example

1. Create campaign with 2 subject line variations
2. Set test sample to 20% of your audience
3. Configure automatic winner selection based on open rate after 4 hours
4. System automatically sends winning variation to remaining 80%

- **utm_campaign**: Uses your campaign name for tracking
- **utm_content**: Automatically set to the template ID for content identification

### Example UTM Implementation

**Original Link**: `https://yourwebsite.com/products`

**With UTM Parameters**:

```
https://yourwebsite.com/products?utm_source=notifuse&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=summer_sale_2024
```

### Analytics Integration

- **Campaign Attribution**: Understand which emails drive website traffic and conversions
- **ROI Measurement**: Calculate campaign effectiveness and return on investment

## Scheduling Options

### Manual Sending

### Scheduled Sending

### Scheduling Best Practices
