## Audience Targeting

Broadcast campaigns offer flexible audience targeting through both contact lists and dynamic segments, allowing you to reach the right people with precision.

### Send to Multiple Lists

- **Multiple Selection**: Choose multiple contact lists for a single campaign
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Automatically skips duplicate email addresses across lists
- **Unified Audience**: Combines all selected lists into one targeted campaign

**Example**: Send a product announcement to both "Newsletter Subscribers" and "VIP Customers" lists while ensuring each contact receives only one email, even if they're on both lists.

### Segment Filters

Apply dynamic segment filters to further refine your broadcast audience based on contact properties and behavior:

- **Property-Based Filtering**: Target contacts by `lifetime_value`, `orders_count`, location, or any custom fields
- **Behavioral Filtering**: Reach contacts based on email engagement (opens, clicks, bounces)
- **Combined Filters**: Use multiple segment conditions with AND/OR logic for precise targeting
- **Real-Time Updates**: Segment membership is evaluated at send time, ensuring accuracy
- **List + Segment**: Combine list selection with segment filters for maximum targeting precision

#### Segment Filter Examples

- **High-Value Customers**: Send to "All Customers" list + segment filter for `lifetime_value >= 1000`
- **Re-engagement**: Target "Newsletter" list + segment for contacts who haven't opened emails in 90 days
- **Geographic Campaigns**: Use "All Contacts" + segment filter for `country = "US"` AND `state = "California"`
- **Purchase Behavior**: Target segments with `orders_count >= 3` to reward loyal customers

**Important**: When both lists and segment filters are applied, only contacts that belong to the selected lists AND match the segment criteria will receive the broadcast.

## A/B Testing

Optimize your campaigns by testing different variations with your audience.

### Test Setup

- **Sample Size**: Test variations on a percentage of your total recipients
- **Multiple Variations**: Create different subject lines, content, or templates
- **Control Groups**: Automatically split your test audience evenly

### Winner Selection

#### Manual Selection

- **Review Results**: Analyze performance metrics for each variation
- **Choose Winner**: Manually select the best-performing variation
- **Send to Remaining**: Deploy the winning variation to the rest of your audience

#### Automatic Selection

Configure automatic winner selection based on performance metrics:

**Open Rate Winner**

- **Metric**: Highest email open rate percentage
- **Time Period**: Set a specific duration (e.g., 2 hours, 24 hours)
- **Auto-Deploy**: Automatically send winning variation after the period

**Click Rate Winner**

- **Metric**: Highest click-through rate percentage
- **Time Period**: Set a specific duration for evaluation
- **Auto-Deploy**: Automatically send winning variation after the period

### A/B Testing Example

1. Create campaign with 2 subject line variations
2. Set test sample to 20% of your audience
3. Configure automatic winner selection based on open rate after 4 hours
4. System automatically sends winning variation to remaining 80%

## UTM Tracking

### Automatic UTM Parameters

All external links in your email templates automatically receive UTM parameters for comprehensive tracking:

- **utm_source**: Identifies the email source
- **utm_medium**: Set to "email" for all broadcast campaigns
- **utm_campaign**: Uses your campaign name for tracking
- **utm_content**: Automatically set to the template ID for content identification

### Example UTM Implementation

**Original Link**: `https://yourwebsite.com/products`

**With UTM Parameters**:

```
https://yourwebsite.com/products?utm_source=notifuse&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=summer_sale_2024
```

### Analytics Integration

- **Google Analytics**: Track email performance in your analytics dashboard
- **Campaign Attribution**: Understand which emails drive website traffic and conversions
- **ROI Measurement**: Calculate campaign effectiveness and return on investment

## Scheduling Options

### Manual Sending

- **Immediate Delivery**: Send your campaign right away
- **Review Before Send**: Final review and approval before deployment
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track delivery and engagement as it happens

### Scheduled Sending

- **Date & Time Selection**: Choose specific delivery date and time
- **Timezone Awareness**: Respects your workspace timezone settings
- **Advance Planning**: Schedule campaigns days or weeks in advance
- **Modification Window**: Edit or cancel scheduled campaigns before send time

### Scheduling Best Practices

- **Optimal Timing**: Schedule for when your audience is most active
- **Time Zone Considerations**: Consider your audience's geographic distribution
- **Avoid Peak Times**: Prevent delivery during holidays or industry-specific busy periods

## Campaign Workflow

1. **Create Campaign**: Set name, description, and goals
2. **Select Audience**: Choose target contact lists and apply segment filters (duplicates automatically removed)
3. **Choose Template**: Select and customize your email template
4. **Configure A/B Testing**: Set up variations and winner selection criteria (optional)
5. **Review Settings**: Confirm audience size, UTM parameters, and schedule
6. **Send or Schedule**: Deploy immediately or schedule for later delivery
7. **Monitor Results**: Track delivery, opens, clicks, and conversions

## Transmission Failure Handling

### Circuit Breaker Protection

Notifuse includes built-in protection against email delivery issues through a circuit breaker mechanism:

- **Failure Threshold**: After 5 consecutive transmission failures, the circuit breaker automatically pauses the broadcast
- **Automatic Pause**: The broadcast status changes to "Paused" with a clear reason indicating the circuit breaker was triggered
- **Immediate Protection**: This prevents further failed attempts and protects your sender reputation

### Failed Message Behavior

When the circuit breaker triggers:

- **Failed Messages**: The 5 recipients that caused the failures are marked as "failed" in the Message History Logs
- **No Automatic Retry**: These failed messages will NOT be retried when the broadcast resumes
- **Permanent Failure**: The affected recipients will not receive the message for this campaign

### Manual Resume Required

- **Manual Intervention**: Broadcasts paused by the circuit breaker must be manually resumed from the UI
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Before resuming, investigate and resolve the underlying delivery issues
- **Fresh Start**: When resumed, the broadcast continues from where it left off, skipping the previously failed messages

### Common Failure Scenarios

Circuit breaker activation typically occurs due to:

- **Email Provider Issues**: Temporary outages or rate limit exceeded
- **Authentication Problems**: Invalid API keys or credentials
- **Configuration Errors**: Incorrect SMTP settings or provider configuration
- **Reputation Issues**: High bounce rates or spam complaints

### Recovery Steps

1. **Check Message History Logs** to identify the specific failure reasons
2. **Resolve the underlying issue** (fix credentials, contact provider, etc.)
3. **Resume the broadcast** manually from the campaign interface
4. **Monitor closely** to ensure successful delivery continues

## Best Practices

- **List Segmentation**: Use multiple targeted lists rather than one large list
- **A/B Testing**: Always test subject lines and content for better engagement
- **UTM Consistency**: Use consistent campaign naming for better analytics tracking
- **Schedule Strategically**: Time your sends for maximum audience engagement
- **Monitor Performance**: Review metrics to improve future campaigns
- **Provider Monitoring**: Keep an eye on your email provider status and limits
- **Test Campaigns**: Send test campaigns to verify configuration before large broadcasts
