## What is a Workspace?

A workspace in Notifuse is a self-contained environment that includes:

- **Contacts and Lists**: Your subscriber database and segmentation
- **Email Templates**: Custom designs and layouts
- **Campaigns**: Broadcast and automated email sequences
- **Transactional Notifications**: Event-triggered emails
- **Message & webhooks History**: All messages sent to the contact and webhooks received
- **Settings**: Email providers and configurations
- **Custom Endpoint URL**: Workspace-specific domain for click tracking, unsubscribe links, and notification center

## Custom Endpoint URL

Each workspace can be configured with a custom endpoint URL to provide a branded experience for your recipients. This custom domain is used for:

- **Click Tracking**: All tracked links in your emails will use your custom domain
- **Unsubscribe Links**: Recipients will see your branded domain when unsubscribing
- **Notification Center**: Your notification center will be accessible via your custom domain

This feature allows you to maintain brand consistency and build trust with your recipients by using your own domain instead of the default Notifuse domain.

## Multi-Tenant Architecture

- **Complete Isolation**: Each workspace operates independently
- **Separate Databases**: Contacts, campaigns, and data are isolated
- **Individual Settings**: Each workspace has its own email providers and configurations
- **Custom Branding**: Each workspace can use its own domain for all recipient-facing URLs
