Firecrawl provides web scraping and search capabilities that enhance the AI agent's ability to access and process web content. When combined with the [Anthropic integration](/integrations/anthropic), it gives the AI agent web access for research and content generation.

## Configuration

Navigate to **Settings** → **Integrations** → **Add Integration** → **Firecrawl**.

### Form Fields

| Field          | Description                                              | Example                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **API Key**    | Your Firecrawl API key                                   | `fc-...`                     |
| **Base URL**   | Custom API endpoint (optional)                           | `https://api.firecrawl.dev`  |

<Note>
Leave the Base URL blank to use the default Firecrawl API (`api.firecrawl.dev`). Only specify a custom URL if you're using a self-hosted Firecrawl instance.
</Note>

## Available Tools

When Firecrawl is configured, the following tools become available to the AI agent:

| Tool           | Description                                                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scrape_url`   | Scrapes a URL and returns its content as clean markdown        |
| `search_web`   | Searches the web and returns relevant URLs with snippets       |

## How It Enhances the AI Agent

When both Firecrawl and [Anthropic](/integrations/anthropic) integrations are configured, the AI agent gains powerful web capabilities:

### Web Research

| Capability              | Description                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Search the web**      | Find current information, news, and trends relevant to your content |
| **Extract content**     | Pull text from specific URLs for reference or inspiration |
| **Competitive research**| Analyze competitor websites and content                |

### Blog Content Creation

With web access, the AI can:

- Research topics thoroughly before writing
- Include up-to-date information and statistics
- Reference and link to authoritative sources
- Verify facts against current web content

### Email Marketing

Enhance email content with:

- Current industry trends and news
- Product information from your website
- Competitive positioning insights

## Prerequisites

Before configuring Firecrawl:

1. **Firecrawl Account**: Create an account at [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev)
2. **API Key**: Generate an API key from the Firecrawl dashboard
3. **Credits**: Ensure your account has sufficient API credits

## Usage Notes

<Warning>
Each web search or URL scrape counts toward your Firecrawl API quota. Monitor your usage in the Firecrawl dashboard to manage costs.
</Warning>

<Tip>
The AI agent will automatically use these tools when web access is needed. For best results, ensure your Firecrawl plan has sufficient credits for your expected usage.
